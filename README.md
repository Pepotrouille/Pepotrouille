# Hello there 🎃
My name is Marie, a.k.a. Pepotrouille or Pepo.  
I am a computer science student and a pixel artist during my free time. I like to tinker and work on small projects. You will mainly find here:

## On my Git, you might find 
- 🎮 Small video games, for game jam or personnal projects,
- 🎨 Aseprite Scripts, small ones but they might help you as much as they helped me!
- 🌐 Web pages, some more interesting than others
- 📚 School projects, 

## You can find more of my projects on the following websites:

- 🖌️ My asset-oriented Itch.io: https://marie-pepo.itch.io/ where you can find free pixel art asset
